In Python, a class is a template for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class, and it has the attributes and methods defined by the class.



A class attribute is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class. It is defined outside of any method in the class, and it has the same value for all instances.



An instance attribute is a variable that is specific to each instance of a class. It is defined inside a method (e.g., __init__) and it can have different values for different instances.



A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. It is defined using the @classmethod decorator.



An instance method is a method that is bound to the instance of the class. It is defined inside the class, but not using the @classmethod decorator.



The __init__ method is a special method in Python classes that is called when a new object is created. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object.



The __repr__ method is a special method in Python classes that is used to define a string representation of an instance of the class. It is called when the repr() function is applied to an instance of the class.



The __del__ method is a special method in Python classes that is called when an instance of the class is about to be destroyed (i.e., garbage collected). It is also known as the "destructor" method because it is responsible for cleaning
